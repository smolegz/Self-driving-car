This project is created using vanilla Javascript where I followed through a tutorial conducted by Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor.

The project uses a fundamental feed-forward neural network which allows the self-driving car to "decide" which path to choose. The project adopts genetic algorithm whereby the "best" car is saved into local memory and further improved. In this project, sevaral variables can be manipulated to study the effects of the neural network, they are the: number of sensors, no. of car spawns, the weight & biases of the nodes, as well as the number of layers of the network.
