This project is created using vanilla Javascript where I followed through a tutorial conducted by Dr. Radu Mariescu-Istodor.

The project uses fundamental neural network which allows the car to "decide" which path to choose. The project uses genetic algorithm where the "best" car is saved and further improved.
